# Exercises from Deep Minds course at UCL about Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning

## Setup

- python3.6
- tensorflow 1.13.1
- jupyter 4.4.0

## General Links

- [Youtube Playlist of Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOh7QUZGyiU&list=PLqYmG7hTraZDNJre23vqCGIVpfZ_K2RZs)

- [Github repo with exercises](https://github.com/RylanSchaeffer/ucl-adv-dl-rl). All repos I found where dated in 2017, while lectures were actually in 2018. We'll see if they drift apart.

## Deep Learning Assignment 1

- [Xavier Initialization](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a.html)
- Tensorflow
  - [Tutorial for MNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials)
  - The tutorial of Tensorflow without Keras seems to be not online anymore. Here a [Blog](https://anil.io/blog/deep-learning/tensorflow-mnist-beginners/) which seems to have followed the tutorial. However I decided to code the assignment with Keras.
  - [Softmax cross entropy with logits](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/nn/softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits)
  - [GradientDescent Optimizer](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/GradientDescentOptimizer)
- Keras
  - [Core Layers](https://keras.io/layers/core/)
  - [Convolutional Layer](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/)
  - [Max Pooling Layer](https://keras.io/layers/pooling/)
